# GifTastic

This code uses the Giphy API to generate 10 gifs featuring the animal that the clicked button is labeled with.  Each gif is generated paused, but will played when the user clicks on it.  If the user clicks on an animated gif, the gif will pause.  If the user wants to see gifs of an animal that is not currently listed with the current buttons, they may use the input field to make a new button featuring the animal they typed in.  The new button will be added to the list and will function with the rest of them.

That's pretty much it, enjoy!
